What is TECK LAB ?

A lab should serve as a transformative space for children, igniting their minds and empowering them to engage in

independent activities using the available resources. By familiarizing themselves with the tools and equipment in the
lab, they can unlock their potential and accomplish remarkable feats. They can dedicate their time to innovation,
finding solutions, and creating new things such as models, games, and apps. The lab's equipment encompasses
various subjects, addressing society's daily needs and incorporating the latest advancements in both hardware and
software.

Introducing TECK labsâ€”an exceptional learning environment where students of all grades converge to actively
participate in hands-on, practical STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. Our TECK
labs serve as educational spaces that foster active learning and problem-solving. They provide students with the
opportunity to cultivate their scientific, engineering, and mathematical skills by utilizing technology to collaborate,
create, and complete projects.

Envision a technology-enhanced learning environment where every element revolves around the students,
supporting theme-based and project-based learning. It is crucial to consider how applications and technologies
complement one another as integral components of project-based learning.

Each TECK lab is equipped with laptops, electronic components , electrical and mechanical tools and 3D printers.
These devices facilitate 3D model creation, coding skill development, robotics control, and much more! The
utilization of these materials encourages students to enhance their critical thinking abilities and expand their
engineering skills.

In summary, our TECK labs are designed to empower students, foster creativity, and nurture their passion
for STEM subjects. By providing a technology-rich environment, we aim to inspire the next generation of
innovators and problem solvers.
